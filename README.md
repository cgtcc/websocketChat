This is a Cyber Chat sample script to demonstrate the possibilities of the WebSocket (ws)  npm module.

Run
    npm install
and then start with
    node ws.js

And then double click on index.html to open it in a browser (don't use the node server for viewing the file)
You may want to open this file twice, in two different browsers, so you can see the interaction between both, through the websocket server.
